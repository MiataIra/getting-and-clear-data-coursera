This code book describes the variables, the data and any
transformations. Analysis is done as part of the course ``getting and
Clearning Data''.

(dataset are too large to upload to this Github repository)

Description of the dataset from the source website:
\url{http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones}

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two
sets, where 70\% of the volunteers was selected for generating the
training data and 30\% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows
of 2.56 sec and 50\% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components,
was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low
frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency
was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by
calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

The dataset includes the following files:

`README.txt'

`features\_info.txt': Contains information about the variables.

`features.txt': List of all features.

`activity\_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

`train/X\_train.txt': Training set.

`train/y\_train.txt': Training labels.

`test/X\_test.txt': Test set.

`test/y\_test.txt': Test labels.

\subsection{The following files are available for the train and test
data. Their descriptions are
equivalent.}\label{the-following-files-are-available-for-the-train-and-test-data.-their-descriptions-are-equivalent.}}

`train/subject\_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who
performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to
30.

`train/Inertial Signals/total\_acc\_x\_train.txt': The acceleration
signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity
units `g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description
applies for the `total\_acc\_x\_train.txt' and
`total\_acc\_z\_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

`train/Inertial Signals/body\_acc\_x\_train.txt': The body acceleration
signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

`train/Inertial Signals/body\_gyro\_x\_train.txt': The angular velocity
vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are
radians/second.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Script
  ``run\_analysis.R'' downloads zip-file by ``curl\_download'', unpacks
  the contents by ``unzip'' and load both test and train data by
  ``read.table''. Combining sets to create one data set is done using
  the command. Merging sets to create one data set is done using the
  commands ``bind\_rows'' and ``bind\_col''.
\item
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for
  each measurement. R-script in ``run\_analysis.R'' extracts first the
  names of the colomn with ``mean'' and standard deviation ``std'' and
  after that extracts only necessary.
\item
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
  set. Script ``run\_analysis.R'' uses the activity labels from
  ``activity\_labels.txt''.
\item
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  Script ``run\_analysis.R'' adds appropriately descriptive variable
  names to the large dataset columns (variables).
\item
  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
  set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
  subject. Script ``run\_analysis.R'' calculates the average for all
  measurement columns grouped by variables and then writes the output to
  a local text file named ``FinalData.txt''"
