## Description
This code book describes the variables, the data and any transformations. Analysis is done as part of the course "getting and Clearning Data".

## The Data Source

Source data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip (dataset are too large to upload to this Github repository)

Description of the dataset from the source website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."

The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Contains information about the variables.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

## Transformation 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Script "run_analysis.R" downloads zip-file by "curl_download", unpacks the contents by "unzip" and load both test and train data by "read.table". Combining sets to create one data set is done using the command. Merging sets to create one data set is done using the commands "bind_rows" and "bind_col".

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. R-script in "run_analysis.R" extracts first the names of the colomn with "mean" and standard deviation "std" and after that extracts only necessary.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Script "run_analysis.R" uses the activity labels from "activity_labels.txt".

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Script "run_analysis.R" adds appropriately descriptive variable names to the large dataset columns (variables).

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Script "run_analysis.R" calculates the average for all measurement columns grouped by variables and then writes the output to a local text file named "FinalData.txt""
